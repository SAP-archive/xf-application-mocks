# XF-Application-Mocks 

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/xf-application-mocks/)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/xf-application-mocks/)

Contains lightweight substitutes for SAP applications to ease the development and testing of extension and integration scenarios based on [Varkes](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes). Together with `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime`, it allows for efficient implementation of application extensions without the need to access the real SAP applications during development.

## Description

The `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime` is designed to easily extend and mash up different SAP applications and third-party APIs. To demo `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime` functionality, you can use a dummy application for integration rather than a full-blown application setup.

A smart and lightweight mock application allows you to save installation time, maintenance effort, and resources. Use its user-friendly interface to:

- Successfully simulate requests or Events sent from an external system to `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime`, and returned responses.
- Testing functionality in or on top of the `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime` without worrying about the dependencies.

The application mocks in this repository provide dummy implementations for most of the SAP Customer Experience applications. They are not bound to `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime` scenarios and can be operated standalone. All mocks are built with the API-driven approach in mind.

## Requirements

The application mocks are NodeJS projects based on [Varkes](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes) libraries and [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) web framework.
To run them, you require a Docker-based container infrastructure, like pure Docker, Kubernetes or `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime`.

## Installation

Each application mock holds detailed installation instructions in a `README` file:

- [SAP Commerce Cloud Mock](commerce-mock/README.md)
- [SAP Marketing Cloud Mock](marketing-mock/README.md)
- [SAP Cloud for Customer Mock](c4c-mock/README.md)

## Usage

To run the mocks using Kyma as the runtime environment, run the following kubectl command to set up a namespace:

``` bash
kubectl create namespace mocks
kubectl label namespace mocks env=true
```

and to deploy the mock on `SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma Runtime`

``` bash
kubectl apply -n mocks -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/xf-application-mocks/master/commerce-mock/deployment/kyma.yaml
kubectl apply -n mocks -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/xf-application-mocks/master/marketing-mock/deployment/kyma.yaml
kubectl apply -n mocks -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/xf-application-mocks/master/c4c-mock/deployment/kyma.yaml
```

## Known issues

The application mocks based on the `@varkes/odata-mock` (currently the marketing and c4c mocks) do not support any relations between the model definitions provided in the related `EDMX` files. A solution supporting the full `EDMX` specification will be provided soon.
